# Final Essay Writing Notes (Methodology – Results – Discussion – Academic Writing)

---

## 1. Research Methodology

### 1.1 Research Approach vs Research Method

- **Research Approach**:  
  The theoretical framework or paradigm guiding the study (qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods).
- **Research Method**:  
  The practical implementation of the research, including:
  - Study design
  - Sampling
  - Ethics
  - Data collection
  - Data analysis

---

### 1.2 What is Research Methodology?

Research methodology explains:

- How data is collected
- How data is cleaned and prepared
- Which analysis techniques are used
- How models/tools are selected and evaluated

Purpose:

- Transparency
- Reproducibility
- Validity of results

---

### 1.3 Structure of the Methodology Section

The methodology section is the **core** of an academic paper and typically includes:

#### a) Dataset

- One paragraph describing:
  - Source of the data
  - Size and characteristics
  - Type of data (numerical, textual, image, etc.)
- One figure representing the dataset
- Proper citation of dataset source

#### b) Overall Workflow

- Use a workflow diagram to show the full process
- Explain the workflow in **one paragraph**
- Clearly describe each step from start to finish
- Helps standardize and justify the research process

#### c) Experimental Settings

Explain:

- Software used (e.g., SPSS, Python, SQL)
- Tools or instruments
- Parameter settings
- Materials or datasets applied

### 1.4 Writing Methodology – Phrase Bank

**Describing existing methods**

- “Traditionally, X has been assessed by…”
- “Several methods currently exist for measuring X…”
- “Previous studies have based their criteria on…”

**Describing current research**

- “The present study utilises X to analyse…”
- “A qualitative/mixed-methods approach is employed…”
- “This investigation utilises statistical techniques to…”

**Justifying method selection**

- “This method was chosen to ensure that…”
- “The approach allows deeper insight into…”
- “The main advantage of using this method is that…”

---

## 2. Results Section

### 2.1 Writing the Results

- Use **3 or more paragraphs**
- Each paragraph answers **one research question**
- Include figures and tables where appropriate
- **Only present results** — no interpretation or opinion

---

### 2.2 Referring to Tables and Figures

Useful phrases:

- “Table 1 shows…”
- “Figure 2 presents…”
- “As shown in Figure 1…”
- “From Table 3, it can be seen that…”

---

### 2.3 Highlighting Significant Results

- “What stands out in the table is…”
- “A clear trend can be observed…”
- “An inspection of the data reveals that…”

---

### 2.4 Stating Results

**Positive results**

- “A significant positive correlation was found…”
- “The results indicate that…”
- “This result is significant at p = 0.05”

**Negative results**

- “No significant difference was found…”
- “X appeared to be unaffected by Y…”
- “The results show no clear pattern…”

**Unexpected results**

- “Interestingly, the correlation suggests that…”
- “One surprising finding was that…”

---

## 3. Discussion Section

### 3.1 Writing the Discussion

- 3–4 paragraphs
- Each paragraph discusses **one research question**
- Explain whether results were:
  - Expected
  - Unexpected
  - Surprising
- Interpret results and explain implications
- Highlight novelty and contribution

---

### 3.2 Linking Results to Literature

- “Previous studies have shown that…”
- “This finding is consistent with Smith (2020)…”
- “Contrary to earlier research, this study found…”

---

### 3.3 Explaining Contradictions

- “This discrepancy may be due to…”
- “One possible explanation is…”
- “These differences could be attributed to…”

---

### 3.4 Impact of Findings

- “These findings suggest that…”
- “The results provide support for…”
- “This study contributes to a growing body of research…”

---

## 4. Conclusion Writing

Structure (3–5 lines total):

1. What the study aimed to do
2. What was found
3. Key takeaways and target population
4. Future research directions

Useful phrases:

- “This study has shown that…”
- “The findings clearly indicate that…”
- “Future research should focus on…”

---

## 5. Abstract Writing (Very Important)

- 2 sentences: background & importance
- 2 sentences: research gap & problem
- 2 sentences: methodology
- 2 sentences: results
- 1 sentence: significance & contribution

Rules:

- No symbols
- No equations
- No references
- No special characters

---

## 6. Academic Writing Mechanics

### 6.1 Key Writing Principles

- Subject–verb agreement
- Consistent tense
- Conciseness

- Passive: “The data was analysed…”
- Active: “The researchers analysed the data…”

---

## 7. Literature Review & Contribution

### Literature Review

- Summarize prior work
- Compare methods and findings
- Use tables to structure comparisons

### Gap Analysis

- Identify what has NOT been done
- Clearly state the missing area

### Problem Statement

- Clearly list research questions (RQ1, RQ2, RQ3)

### Novelty of Work

- Explain how your study is different
- State your contribution clearly

---

## 8. Referencing Styles

- APA
- MLA
- Chicago
- IEEE

Use reference generators if needed:

- MyBib
- CiteThisForMe
- Quillbot Citation Generator

---

## Final Tip
